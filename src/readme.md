BERTRAND McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering
 the source BEHIND the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum,
  his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, altoit core, Latin word. 
  Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum 
(“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
